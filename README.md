# MBot-LED-Settings-App
This app was made with kivy and @xecos library for contrlling the mbot with python

There are 3 textinputs for the red , green and blue. 2 labels that are literally useless you can change them and 1 button to update everything.
When your un this you can only use it once idk why.

The nxt project will be terminal based but it includes data analysis aka using the pandas lib, it will also control the mbot's led colour.
